# Rock it, Metal

Description:

"Rock it, Metal" is an anti-2D platformer, this means that it is designed to contradict traditional 2D platformer controls.

It ditches the standard, gameplay focused approach to design, instead opting for a heavier focus on exploration and environmental
storytelling.

This vertical slice of the game has you exploring an abandoned facility deep in outer space, and lets you roam around and discover what
led to it's abandonment.

Controls:

- AD to move Left & Right
- Left Click on a surface to use Grappling Hook

Assets used:
